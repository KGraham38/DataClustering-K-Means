class UniformRandomSelection {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("testsr");

        //Indicated desired inputs for reference:
        //% F = iris_bezdek.txt (name of data file)
        //% K = 3 (number of clusters)
        //% I = 100 (maximum number of iterations in a run)
        //% T = 0.000001 (convergence threshold)
        //% R = 100 (number of runs)
        //% test is the name of the executable file
        //% “>” indicates command-prompt, which is not part of the output

        //Valid command prompt
        //test iris_bezdek.txt 3 100 0.000001 100

        //Example output format:
        //5.1 3.4 1.5 0.2
        //7.2 3.2 6 1.8
        //4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2

        //Four dimensions so 4 items in each row, 3 lines because k = 3
    }
}



//Java Practices and Style Guide from my Google search: This one seems to cover a little more https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html
//However, I like the layout of the sections better on this one, so I will reference both (they should contain basically the same information as these practice are kind of industry standard I think)
//but I will primarily use https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/JavaAndDS/JavaStyle.html
